# lingo
####A visualization project using the Twitter API to find the most popular slang being used in 5 major cities.

A collaborative project with [Jennifer Vandermeer](https://github.com/vandermeerjl), 
[Adalyn Ordono](https://github.com/aordono), and [Natalia Bagan](https://github.com/nbagan).

Lingo measures the use of slang words in 5 different English-speaking cities around the world and allows the user to compare slang use in each.
The bigger the word in the visualization, the more popular it is!

This repository does not include code for the Lingo Content Manager, which allows users to input their own slang for approval by the administrators.
This feature is available to use on the [live site](http://jennifervandermeer.ca/lingo/).

The visualization is a customized version of [Julien Renaux's D3 Word Cloud](https://github.com/shprink/d3js-wordcloud).
